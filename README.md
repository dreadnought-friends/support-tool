# Dreadnought Community Support Tool
Automates collecting the Dreadnought log files, creating a DxDiag report, the
MSInfo export and the host.developer.log file. All files will be packed in a
`DN_Support.zip` file on your desktop and are ready to be send to Customer
Support.

## Using the Tool
There's no need for an installation. The tool can be ran on windows by
downloading the latest executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/dreadnought-friends/support-tool/releases).
When downloaded you can run the executable to collect the data that CS needs.

You can also find me (`Anyone#8869`) on the [Dreadnought Discord](https://discord.gg/dreadnought).
